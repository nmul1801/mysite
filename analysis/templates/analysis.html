        <h3>Bonage Index</h3>
        <p class="mt-3">
            Bonage index aims to capture how much a team gets boned each week. A team's BI is calculated by the 
            following: size of league - weekly rank of opponent + 1. For example, if a team in a 10 man league matches 
            up against the team that ends up scoring the second most points that week, their BI would be 10 - 2 + 1,
            giving them a BI of 9 that week.

        <h3>Expected Wins</h3>
        <p class="mt-3">
            A team's weekly expected wins is the percentage of teams that they would have beaten 
            that week. It is calculated by taking a team's rank in the league - 1 and dividing that 
            by the size of the league - 1. For example, if a leauge has 11 members, and a team ranks
            6th on a given week, then their E(W) is 0.5. If a team ranks firs, E(W) = 1, and if they
            rank last, E(W) = 0.

        <h3>Difference in Expected Wins and Actual Wins</h3>
        <p class="mt-3">
            Combining expected wins with actual wins can give us a better idea of how 
            lucky/unlucky a team is. For example, if a team could have only beaten one other team 
            (low E(W)) and they win that week (W = 1), then [W - E(W)]  would be close to 1. 
            Or, if a team could have beaten most teams in the league, but they lose, E(W) is a
            decimal close to 1, W = 0, so [W - E(W)] is close to -1. Add [W - E(W)] for every 
            week, and you get an idea of how lucky a team has been overall, where a negative number
            indicates a team has been unlucky, and a positive number indicates a team has been lucky.

        <p class="mt-3">
            Taking the total of [W - E(W)] for all weeks, we can find the likelihood of this difference
            occurring by standardizing to binomial distribution. Each game is either won or lost based 
            on a team's E(W) for that given week. So after n trials (number of weeks), what are the 
            odds that you are at least [W - E(W)] from the mean. In this case, the mean is 0, as without any luck,
            E(W) = W, so W - E(W) = 0. The teams that had a [W - E(W)] above zero (more lucky) are farther left, and 
            the teams with a [W - E(W)] below zero (more unlucky) are to the right.

            Standard deviation over a team's scores all season measures their consistency. More consistent teams are toward the

        <p class="mt-3">A players' sleeper score (SS) is calculated using two other metrics</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Positional Rank (PR)</strong> is a players' relative standing based on fantasy 
            points, only including players that are in their position. For example, both the 
            highest-scoring RB and the highest-scoring WR will have a PR of 1. And the 5th highest-scoring 
            running back will have a PR of 5, no matter how many QBs, Kickers, Defenses, etc. have scored 
            higher.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Positional Pick (PP)</strong> measures the number of players within the same position 
            that were drafted before a particular player of that position. For example, if Tyreek Hill 
            was the second wide reciever selected in the draft, he would have a PP of 2. And if Kenneth 
            Walker was the tenth running back selected in the draft, he would have a PP of 10.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Sleeper Score (SS)</strong> is calculated by taking a player's PP and subtracting their 
            PR. This measures their difference in their perceived value (PP) and their actual value (PR).
            Players with a high sleeper score were thought to be poor-performing and turned out to perform 
            well.
        </p>

        <p>For example, 
            {{sleepers_dict_items.0.1.name}} 
            was the <strong>{{sleepers_dict_items.0.1.position_pick_written}}  {{sleepers_dict_items.0.0}}</strong> drafted.
            He ended up scoring the <strong>{{sleepers_dict_items.0.1.pos_rank_written}}</strong> most among his position, giving
            him a sleeper score of <strong>{{sleepers_dict_items.0.1.sleeper_score}}</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Note that this is not a good metric for dynasty leagues</p>
